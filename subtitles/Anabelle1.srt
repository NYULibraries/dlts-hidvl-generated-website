00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:04,133
Hi Anabelle, Can you please introduce 
yourself for this project. This is the second subtitle

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,900
Yes. My name is 
Anabelle Contreras-Castro,

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,266
and I am a professor in the National 
University of Costa Rica.

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:16,200
I am a professor in the school 
of Scenic Arts,

5
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,033
and I direct a doctoral program, 
which is called

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,933
the Discipline of Arts and 
Letters in Central America.

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:24,700
Thank you.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,633
How is Performance Studies 
understood in Costa Rica?

9
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:33,101
Well, until recently, it was a 
relatively unknown field;

10
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:37,068
we never had a performance studies 
movement like other countries had.

11
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,801
We had artists who did performance,

12
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,335
some without knowing it, 
some did know,

13
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:46,568
and some people who had written some,

14
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,335
but there were no formal studies 
in the academy.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,836
So, from there, we had the idea to 
introduce performance studies

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,536
in the National University in the 
school of Scenic Arts,

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,003
and we created

18
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:11,801
a formal degree program

19
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:15,603
in which we introduced performance 
studies

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,105
as a mode of research,
and also practice,

21
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:20,871
with some concepts

22
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,738
we had been needing,

23
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:25,971
and also to break up a little

24
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:31,438
the direction the school had been 
going, which was exclusively theater.

25
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:35,271
So there was, let’s say, a debate, 
or a conflict,

26
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,638
between theater and visual arts,

27
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,605
in relation to performance,

28
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:44,073
if it was interesting as practice 
or as methodology?

29
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:48,873
I don’t think it was an open debate, 
not a prior conflict.

30
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,806
What there was first was the seminar,

31
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,906
and the doubts came later,

32
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:56,373
because

33
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:59,471
the seminar had really positive 
results,

34
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:01,906
and immediately people began to doubt

35
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:05,208
if the theater school should take
that path or not.

36
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:10,208
It didn’t generate an open debate,

37
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:14,341
and so we have until today an 
optional course

38
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:19,375
that began as being part of the 
School for Scenic Arts

39
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:22,275
and today is open to all the 
university,

40
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,675
so we receive students from 
all disciplines,

41
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:29,576
who do their optional course

42
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,443
in Performance Studies,

43
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:35,010
half as a theoretical course, 
the other half as practice.

44
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,710
And where do you get your 
theoretical texts?

45
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,276
That is a problem in the smaller 
countries

46
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,410
like in Central America, 
where

47
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,443
they don’t import large quantities 
of books,

48
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,110
books are

49
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:55,878
very expensive because they have 
very high import taxes,

50
00:02:56,178 --> 00:03:01,411
and so we have a fairly informal 
and illegal system.

51
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:07,511
This is to say, we photocopy books, 
we clone them,

52
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,845
we scan them, and we find ways 
to circulate knowledge

53
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:17,945
that are informal and illegal.

54
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,146
Ok, good.

55
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,846
Which are the theorists with the 
strongest presence here?

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,680
Well, we have worked a great deal 
with Diana Taylor’s books,

57
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,946
and some other virtual periodicals.

58
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:40,081
The virtual periodical from the 
Hemispheric Institute

59
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:42,915
has been really important for us,

60
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,281
as well as

61
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:47,748
some theorists from Brazil,

62
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:49,848
South America,

63
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,681
some connected to the Hemispheric 
Institute,

64
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,215
and other things we find 
on the internet,

65
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,615
because in the bookstores you 
can’t find

66
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:00,413
almost any of this stuff.

67
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,948
Yes. Is there anyone here who 
works on these themes?

68
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:05,515
Performance Studies?

69
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,616
Yes, who publishes on this, 
in theoretical terms?

70
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,416
We have many more practice-based works

71
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,283
than theoretical at this moment.

72
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:15,550
This is to say, the elective course 
given

73
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,783
by the university

74
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:21,250
is a place to explore

75
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:24,650
concepts of the body.

76
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,685
It’s very difficult here that they 
understand

77
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,718
in the cultural sector

78
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,383
that you have to intellectually 
produce artists

79
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:37,851
as doers, but more as thinkers 
about what they are doing,

80
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:41,418
and we’re trying to generate material,

81
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,185
but there isn’t much.

82
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,051
Ok, thank you very much.

83
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,283
My pleasure.
